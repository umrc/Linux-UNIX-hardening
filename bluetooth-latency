#Find necessary info about the bluetooth device (while it is connected!)

#The output should be something like
#Name: bluez_card.28_11_A5_84_B6_F9
#Driver: module-bluez5-device.c
#...
#Ports:
#speaker-output: Speaker (priority: 0, latency offset: 0 usec, available)
#    Part of profile(s): a2dp_sink, headset_head_unit
#speaker-input: Bluetooth Input (priority: 0, latency offset: 0 usec, not available)
#    Part of profile(s): headset_head_unit
#We see that the buffers have currently 0 latency. In the next step, you will need the NAME and PORT of your output. In this example, these are bluez_card.28_11_A5_84_B6_F9 and speaker-output, respectively.
#Set the buffer size (latency) of your card to a suitable value with this command pattern:

pactl set-port-latency-offset <NAME> <PORT> <BUFFER_SIZE_MICROSECONDS> 
#The latency unit of the following command is microseconds, so I'm using a 50 millisecond buffer for my command here:

pactl set-port-latency-offset bluez_card.28_11_A5_84_B6_F9 speaker-output 50000 
#Restart your bluetooth service to apply your change
sudo service bluetooth restart
